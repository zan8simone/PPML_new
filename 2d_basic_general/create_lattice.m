%    ====== INPUT 
%
% a1, a2 -> direct space unit cell vectors [each 1x2 real]
% N1, N2 -> direct space unit cell discretization [each integer, better if it is a power of 2 for subsequent FFT]
% trunc -> truncation scheme details.
%             * for circular trunc scheme, set trunc.scheme = 'circ' 
%                                          and trunc.rad    = [an integer] which is the truncation radius
%             * for rectangular truncation scheme, set trunc scheme = 'parall'
%                                                  and trunc.rad1 = [integer]; trunc.rad2 = [integer];
% extra -> extra.plotflag = [1 or 0] to plot or not to plot
%          extra.plotfignum = [integer], the figure number                                                  
%          extra.plotmn = [1 or 0] to plot the (m,n) indices for each reciprocal space basis element
